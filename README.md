# instrumental-MER-data-thesis
The compiled instrumental music dataset used in my Master's thesis 2022

See the compiled tracklists for Soundtracks, DEAM and EMOPIA.
It is recommended to use StratifiedGroupKFold from Sklearn to create train/val/test splits that respects that some clips originate from the same song.
